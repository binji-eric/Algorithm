LintCode 178 Graph Valid Tree
    The defination of Tree:
        (1) There will be n - 1 edges for n nodes
        (2) All the nodes are reached from any node

LeetCode 133 Clone Graph
    (1) use Map to track the relation between old and new node
    (2) add neighbors to new node


LintCode 127 Topological Sorting
    (1) get indegree map of graph
    (2) get startNodes of topological sort
    (3) use bfs get full order
